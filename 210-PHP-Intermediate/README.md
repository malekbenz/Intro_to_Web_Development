## Superglobals 
Superglobals are built-in variables that are always available in all scopes throughout a script. There is no need to do global $variable; to access them within functions or methods.
These superglobal variables are:

- $GLOBALS: An associative array references all variables available in global scope.
- $_SERVER:is an array containing information such as headers, paths, and script locations. The entries in this array are created by the web server.  
- $_GET: HTTP GET variables.
- $_POST: HTTP POST variables.
- $_FILES: HTTP File Upload variables.
- $_COOKIE: HTTP Cookies.
- $_SESSION: Session variables.
- $_REQUEST: An associative array that by default contains the contents of $_GET, $_POST and $_COOKIE.
- $_ENV: An associative array of variables passed to the current script via the environment method.
